# Welcome to the Intro to HTML & CSS Workshop! ðŸ’…



## Let's get familiar with HTML + CSS and build a landing page. 

Here are the [Slides with Examples](https://bit.ly/2sRFc6r)

Make sure you have a text editor like [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)

Remember, to open your file on the web browser: right click your file & Open With: Chrome. 



### Challenge 1 | HTML
1. Create a folder in your explorer/finder for the files we will create today. 
2. Inside of your folder, create an `index.html` file. Open it with your text editor. 
3. Now that you have it open, make sure you have the following code to start your document: 
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title></title>
  </head>

  <body>
  
  </body>
  
</html>
```
4. Give your webpage a title. 
5. In between your `<body>` tags, let's add some HTML structure. Use an `<h1>` tag and give your site a heading.
6. Now use a `<p>` for some text in your site. 
7. Let's use a link in your HTML with an `<a>` tag.
8. Lets put `<div>` tags around all of the content we've created so far.
9. Feel free to include other HTML tags below your the `<div>` you've created + be creative!



### Challenge 2 | CSS
1. First, let's create a new style file: call it `style.css`. 
2. Next, make sure to link it in the head: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`. 
3. Now that we have our main landing `<div>`, let's give it some style: first let's give it a `class="your-class-here"` name. 
4. For the `class` that you have created, let's give it some styling: 
- Find a background image on Unsplash at www.unsplash.com .
- Give the `<div>` a `background-image: url();` and use the image you found. 
- Next, give the `<div>` some `height` & `width`. 
- Next, change the `color` of the text in the `<div>`. 
- Next, let's `text-align: center;` the text in our `<div>`. 
5. Give the `<h1>` in your page some styling: 
- Let's play with the `padding-top` and move it lower on our background image. 
6. Let's add some more style to the other items on your page. Get creative! 
- Check out some properties you can use to style your page: `color`, `background-color`, `font-size`, `object-fit: center,` `border`, `border-radius`, `padding`, `margin`, ``



### Challenge 3 | CSS - Advanced
1. Want to add different fonts? Head to [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). 
- Find a text you like. 
- Copy the `link` tag & put it in your `<head>`. 
- Update your `font-family` css attribute. 
2. Next, import [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). Make sure to link their `stylesheet` in your `<head>`! Remember to scroll down the main page and copy the CSS link under the heading: BootstrapCDN. 
- Add some button styling!
- Add in a navbar for your page. Remember to update the links of the navbar. See if you can link to another page you create.
- Add cards to your page- checkout the Boostrap cards section.
- Add a footer to your page. This may need some custom CSS. 
3. Use `display: flex` and/or `display: grid` to update the layout on your page somewhere.



### Challenge 3 | Going Further
1. Excellent, now let's plan out a site that you want to build. Start by drawing on a piece of paper. Think of the `divs` you need to group things together. 
2. Make a new `html` file to contain all of your content. Start by laying out the `HTML tags` on the page. 
3. Next, create your `style.css` page. Make sure to link it! Begin to give the page some `CSS` and style! Try to make the styling as close as possible to the page you want to build. 
4. Do you need CSS grid or flexbox to make some of the layout changes? 
5. Use Boostrap & Google Fonts to customise your page! 



### Challenge 4 | Google Analytics - Getting Started 
1. Sign up for Google Analytics. 
2. Create an Account. 
3. Create a Property. 
4. Click `Admin` at the bottom left of your page. Once there, under `Property`, click `Data Streams`.
5. Under `Data Streams` in the right pane, you should see an option to add a Web/your website.
6. Once completed, you'll see a bar with your website information. Click this. 
7. A new window will open, and you'll see `Tagging Instructions` part way down. 
8. Expand the `Global Site Tag (gtag.js)` tab. 
9. In the expanded area under `Global Site Tag (gtag.js)`, copy the code. 
10. Paste this code into the `<head>` of your main HTML page/`index.html`. 
11. It will look similar to this: 
```
<html>
<head>
	-- Your pasted Google Analytics Tag scripts --
</head>
</html>
```
12. Congratulations! Now you can track how your users are interacting with your app. 



### Challenge 4 | Launch on Netlify 
1. Sign up for [Netlify](www.netlify.com)
2. Once you're logged in, drag the folder of code you made today into space on Netlify that says: `Want to deploy a new site without connecting to Git? Drag and drop your site folder here`
3. Launch your website & share with your friends!
