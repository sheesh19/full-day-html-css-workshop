# Welcome to the Intro to HTML & CSS Workshop! ðŸ’…

## Let's get familiar with HTML + CSS and build a landing page. 

Here are the [Slides with Examples](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vQWL5q2q5FwKucQ1Y795V8Uw1MaQc6uQ/view?usp=sharing)

Make sure you have a text editor like [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)

Remember, to open your file on the web browser: right click your file & Open With: Chrome. 


### Challenge 1: HTML
1. Create a folder in your explorer/finder for the files we will create today. 
2. Inside of your folder, create an `index.html` file. Open it with your text editor. 
3. Now that you have it open, make sure you have the following code to start your document: 
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title></title>
  </head>

  <body>
  
  </body>
  
</html>
```
4. Give your webpage a title. 
5. In between your `<body>` tags, let's add some HTML structure. Use an `<h1>` tag and give your site a heading.
6. Now use a `<p>` for some text in your site. 
7. Let's use a link in your HTML with an `<a>` tag.
8. Lets put `<div>` tags around all of the content we've created so far.
9. Feel free to include other HTML tags below your the `<div>` you've created + be creative!


### Challenge 2: CSS
1. First, let's create a new style file: call it `style.css`. 
2. Next, make sure to link it in the head: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`. 
3. Now that we have our main landing `<div>`, let's give it some style: first let's give it a `class="your-class-here"` name. 
4. For the `class` that you have created, let's give it some styling: 
- Find a background image on [Unsplash](www.unsplash.com)
- Give the `<div>` a `background-image: url();` and use the image you found. 
- Next, give the `<div>` some `height` & `width`. 
- Next, change the `color` of the text in the `<div>`. 
- Next, let's `text-align: center;` the text in our `<div>`. 
5. Give the `<h1>` in your page some styling: 
- Let's play with the `padding-top` and move it lower on our background image. 
6. Let's add some more style to the other items on your page. Get creative! 
- Check out some properties you can use to style your page: `color`, `background-color`, `font-size`, `object-fit: center,` `border`, `border-radius`, `padding`, `margin`, ``

### Challenge 3: CSS - Advanced
1. Want to add different fonts? Head to [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). 
- Find a text you like. 
- Copy the `link` tag & put it in your `<head>`. 
- Update your `font-family` css attribute. 
2. Next, import [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). Make sure to link their `stylesheet` in your `<head>`! Remember to scroll down the main page and copy the CSS link under the heading: BootstrapCDN. 
- Add some button styling!
- Add in a navbar for your page. Remember to update the links of the navbar. See if you can link to another page you create.
- Add cards to your page- checkout the Boostrap cards section.
- Add a footer to your page. This may need some custom CSS. 


### Challenge 3: Going Further
1. Excellent, now look for a webpage you want to copy. 
2. Start to lay out the `HTML tags` on the page. 
3. Next, begin to give the page some `CSS` and style! Try to make the styling as close as possible to the page. 


### Challenge 4: Launch on Netlify 
1. Sign up for [Netlify](www.netlify.com)
2. Once you're logged in, drag the folder of code you made today into space on Netlify that says: `Want to deploy a new site without connecting to Git? Drag and drop your site folder here`
3. Launch your website & share with your friends!
