# Welcome to the Intro to HTML & CSS Workshop! ðŸ’…



## Let's get familiar with HTML + CSS and build a landing page. 

Here are the [Slides with Examples](https://bit.ly/2sRFc6r)

Make sure you have a text editor like [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

Remember, to open your file on the web browser: right click your file & Open With: Chrome. 



### Challenge 1 | HTML
1. Clone or download this repository (you can use your command line or download it directly to your desktop). 
3. Now that you have the file structure, open it in your text editor, make sure you have the following code to start your document: 
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title></title>
  </head>

  <body>
  
  </body>
  
</html>
```
4. Update the title of your webpage a title. `<title>`
5. In between your `<body>` tags, let's add some HTML structure. Use an `<h1>` tag and give your site a heading.
6. Now use a `<p>` for some text in your site. 
7. Let's use a link in your HTML with an `<a>` tag.
8. Lets put a `<div>` tag around all of the content we've created so far within the `<body>`.
9. Feel free to include other HTML tags below the `<div>` you've created + be creative!



### Challenge 2 | CSS
1. First, navigate to your `style.css` file. What code is already in there? What is it doing? Change the background to a . 
2. Next, make sure to link it in the head: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`. 
3. From your previous challenge, you should have a `<div>` around all the content in your `<body>`. Let's give it some style! First let's give it a class with: `class="your-class-here"`. 
4. For the `class` that you have created, let's give it some styling: 
- Find a background image on Unsplash at www.unsplash.com .
- Give the `<div>` a `background-image: url();` and use the image you found. 
- Next, give the `<div>` some `height` & `width`. 
- Next, change the `color` of the text in the `<div>`. 
- Next, let's `text-align: center;` the text in our `<div>`. 
- Check out more examples of CSS styling here: [W3Schools | CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/)
5. Give the `<h1>` in your page some styling: 
- Let's play with the `padding-top` and move it lower on our background image. 
6. Let's add some more style to the other items on your page. Get creative! 
- Check out some properties you can use to style your page: `color`, `background-color`, `font-size`, `object-fit: center,` `border`, `border-radius`, `padding`, `margin`, ``



### Challenge 3 | CSS - Advanced
1. Want to add different fonts? Head to [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). 
- Find a text you like. 
- Copy the `link` tag & put it in your `<head>`. 
- Update your `font-family` css attribute. 
2. Play around with Flex Box
- Remember that `display: flex` goes on the parent `div` to influence all its children `elements` 
- Good resource: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox
- Fun game: https://flexboxfroggy.com/
- Add in a navbar for your page. Remember to update the links of the navbar. See if you can link to another page you create.
- Add cards to your page using `flexbox` to align everything
- Add a footer to your page. This may need some custom CSS. 



### Challenge 4 | Going Further
1. Excellent, now let's plan out a site that you want to build. Start by drawing on a piece of paper. Think of the `divs` you need to group things together. 
2. Make a new `html` file to contain all of your content. Start by laying out the `HTML tags` on the page. 
3. Next, create your `style.css` page. Make sure to link it! Begin to give the page some `CSS` and style! Try to make the styling as close as possible to the page you want to build. 
4. Do you need CSS grid or flexbox to make some of the layout changes? 
5. Use Boostrap & Google Fonts to customise your page! 



### Challenge 5 | Launch on Netlify 
1. Sign up for [Netlify](www.netlify.com)
2. Once you're logged in, drag the folder of code you made today into space on Netlify that says: `Want to deploy a new site without connecting to Git? Drag and drop your site folder here`
3. Launch your website & share with your friends!
